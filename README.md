## Project Description:
**LensSocialScore** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the **Lens Network** that aims to provide a reputation system for users based on their activity and engagement within the network. The goal is to give users a way to track their influence and contributions to the Lens ecosystem through a combination of metrics like **engagement**, **monetary value**, **diversity** of interactions, and **participation time**. 

This application calculates a user’s reputation score by analyzing their interaction patterns, transactions, and the diversity of their activities on Lens. The score is then visualized on a user-friendly dashboard, helping users understand their influence in the community and track their progress over time.

Key features include:
- **Reputation Calculation**: The score is based on metrics such as interactions (likes, comments), monetary transactions, diversity of activities, and engagement over time.
- **Dynamic Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)**: Each user's score is linked to a non-transferable SBT that updates dynamically to reflect changes in their activity, serving as a verifiable credential for trust and reputation across Web3 platforms.
- **User Dashboard**: A clean interface displaying the user’s reputation score and detailed breakdown by each metric.
- **Integration with Lens Network**: Direct interaction with Lens profiles to gather activity data and calculate scores.
  
LensSocialScore is intended to help users gain insights into their role in the Lens community and encourage more engagement and participation within the network.
